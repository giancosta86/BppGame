# BppGame

*ScalaFX app for the Bin Packing Problem*


## Introduction

*BppGame* is a ScalaFX application enabling users to interactively solve bin-packing problems (BPP); it is extensively based on *TwoBinKernel*, a library provided by the [TwoBinPack](https://github.com/giancosta86/TwoBinPack) suite.

## Requirements

BppGame requires Java 8 update 101 or later compatible version.


## Download and run

* The easier, suggested way to execute the app is via [MoonDeploy](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy): just go to the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/BppGame/releases/latest) and open *App.moondeploy* to automatically download and execute the application.

* Alternatively, the latest binary package can be downloaded [from GitHub](https://github.com/giancosta86/BppGame/releases/latest): the executable script - for both Unix and Windows - is in the *bin* subdirectory.

In case of problems while starting up the application, please check your Java version and your [JAVA_HOME environment variable](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/index.html): starting the program from the command line should also print out a detailed error description.


## Instructions

BppGame is designed to be user-friendly and very intuitive; however, in case of doubts, please have a look at its [wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/BppGame/wiki).
